# Fix
* cmd-s should trigger save-as for new project
* bump project file version and clean up load checks
* add appropriate entries to the macos fSpy menu
* Den kraschar när jag vill starta nytt projekt - Linux

# build
* silence test warning

# linux
* crisper icon (use nativeimage?)
* name: fSpy instead of fspy

# future
* use transform() to scale bg image?
* view menu -> view tool panels
* help menu with link to site
* include camera preset in solver result?
* actions name space
* about window?
* revert to saved
* full screen mode for projector use
* tooltips
* warn when reference distance handles go past the measuring axis vp
* disallow selecting parallel vp axes?
* I imported a camera via the python script and all worked well except it doesn’t use the sensor size I set in fSpy.
The field of view is right, though. It uses 32mm instead of 35mm full frame but adjusted the focal length accordingly. It would be nice if the script also adjusted the sensor size to match the one in fSpy.
* Can it be made possible to place the principal point outside the image area?
